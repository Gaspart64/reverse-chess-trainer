## PGN Format Reminder

Required fields:
```
[FEN "rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"]
[Event "Optional Title"]

1. e4 e5 2. Qh5 f6 3. Qxf7#
```

Without FEN or moves, the puzzle will be skipped.

## Troubleshooting

**"Install app" button doesn't show**
- Ensure HTTPS (GitHub Pages provides this)
- Check manifest.json is valid JSON
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R

**Puzzles don't load**
- Verify PGN has [FEN "..."] tags
- Verify move notation is standard algebraic (e.g., "Nf3", "Qh5#")
- Check no syntax errors in PGN

**Service worker not working**
- Check DevTools → Application → Service Workers
- Look for errors in console
- Try: DevTools → Application → Clear storage → Unregister + refresh

**App won't install on phone**
- Android: Use Chrome, not Firefox or Edge
- iOS: Use Safari, not Chrome
- Check that URL is HTTPS (not HTTP)

## Customization Tips

**Change Theme Color:**
In reverse_chess_trainer.html, find:
```html
<meta name="theme-color" content="#769656">
```
Change `#769656` to your preferred color.

**Change App Name:**
In manifest.json, modify:
```json
"short_name": "Chess Trainer"
```

**Add Your Own Puzzles:**
Create a PGN file and load it in the app. Multiple puzzles can be in one file.

## GitHub Pages URL Structure

If deploying to subdirectory (not main domain):

**Your repo structure:**
```
your-username/chess-trainer/
├── reverse_chess_trainer.html
├── manifest.json
└── sw.js
```

**Access at:**
```
https://your-username.github.io/chess-trainer/
```

All paths are relative, so the app should work automatically!
